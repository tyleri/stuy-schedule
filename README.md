This is a simple website used to keep track of the current period, based
on the schedule of my high school, Stuyvesant High School. This project 
is based off of the schedule website created by Mr. Peter Brooks, a 
teacher at the school. You can find his original website at 
<a href='http://bert.stuy.edu/pbrooks/schedules/schedules.py'>

</a>

<p>
For this website, I used Bootstrap and jQuery, along with my own custom 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since JavaScript doesn't have a separate 
Time class (only a Date class that includes fields for time), I wrote 
my own class to better implement the methods I needed for the function. 
The Time class can be found at the top of the scripts.js file.
