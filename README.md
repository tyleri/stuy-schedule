stuy-schedule
=============

You can find the website for this project at
[tyleri.github.io/stuy-schedule](http://tyleri.github.io/stuy-schedule).

This is a simple website used to keep track of the current period,
using the schedule of Stuyvesant High School. This project is based
off of the schedule website created by Mr. Peter Brooks, who teaches
at the school. You can find his original website at
[bert.stuy.edu/pbrooks/schedules/schedules.py][1].

For this website, I used Bootstrap and jQuery, along with my own
custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since JavaScript doesn't have a
separate Time class (only a Date class that includes fields for time),
I wrote my own class to better implement the methods I needed for the
function.  The Time class can be found at the top of the scripts.js
file.
